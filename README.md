A simple C++ library for POSIX compatible operating systems that enables your project to easily spawn and communicate bidirectionally with client processes in separate terminal emulator instances.

What is it?
-------------------------
When developing a C++ project on for POSIX compatible operting systems (eg GNU/Linux), you may wish to run one or more additional child processes each with access to their own terminal emulator instance, and the ability to communicate bi-directionally with the parent process.

For instance, in the simplest case if the parent process occupies it's terminal emulator instance with it's own output, you may wish to spawn a child process with it's own terminal emulator instance to display messages from the parent process and receive user input to send back.

This can be implemented within a C or C++ project on compatible operting systems using the functionality defined in the [unistd.h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unistd.h), [sys/stat.h](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/POSIX_Reference/sys/stat.h) & [fcntl.h](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/basedefs/fcntl.h.html) headers to spawn a child process, and create [named pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe) that provide a communication channel to-which and from-which the parent and child processes can write and read.

satellite_terminal is a simple library that makes it easy to incorporate this functionality within your own C++ projects by fully automating this process.
<br />
<br />

How to use it?
-------------------------
Using satellite_terminal in a C++ project is very easy. Let's demonstrate this via a trivial example.
<br />

The parent process spawns the child process by instantiating a SatTerm_Server. The server constructor is passed an identifier string, the path to the child process binary as arguments. By default two named pipes will be created to form a tx-rx pair, but an arbitrary of tx and rx named pipes can be created if desired.
<br />
<br />

```cpp

SatTerm_Server sts("test_server", "./client_demo");

// Path to child binary above can incorporate desired command-line arguments
// eg: "./client_demo --full-screen=true"

```
<br />

The server constructor will create the named pipe temporary files in the local directory and then spawn a terminal emulator (from the list in terminal_emulator_paths.txt) within-which it will directly execute the child binary via the '-e' option.

The paths to the named pipes are passed to the child binary as command-line options by appending them to the child binary path string. The server constructor will then block while it waits for the child process to connect.

Blah...
<br />
<br />

```cpp

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	
	size_t argv_start_index = 1;
	SatTerm_Client stc("test_client", argv_start_index, argv);

...
...
```
<br />

Blah [blah]() `blah.cpp`.

Blah.
